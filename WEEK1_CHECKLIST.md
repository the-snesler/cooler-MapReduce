# Week 1 Implementation Checklist

Based on the design.md Phase 1 requirements:

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1) ✅

### Docker Compose Setup ✅
- [x] Created docker-compose.yml with 1 coordinator + 4 workers
- [x] Each worker limited to 1 CPU via deploy.resources.limits
- [x] Shared volume mounted to all containers at /shared
- [x] Custom bridge network for inter-container communication
- [x] Created Dockerfile.coordinator for coordinator image
- [x] Created Dockerfile.worker for worker image

### gRPC Service Definitions ✅
- [x] Created proto/coordinator.proto with CoordinatorService
  - [x] SubmitJob RPC
  - [x] GetJobStatus RPC
  - [x] ListJobs RPC
  - [x] GetJobResults RPC
- [x] Created proto/worker.proto with WorkerService
  - [x] Heartbeat RPC
  - [x] AssignTask RPC
  - [x] GetTaskStatus RPC
- [x] Generated Python code from proto files (pb2.py, pb2_grpc.py)

### Basic Coordinator Scaffolding ✅
- [x] Implemented CoordinatorServicer class
- [x] Job submission handling with UUID generation
- [x] Job state tracking (JobState class)
- [x] All RPC methods implemented
- [x] Proper logging
- [x] Server runs on port 50051

### Basic Worker Scaffolding ✅
- [x] Implemented WorkerServicer class
- [x] Task assignment handling
- [x] Task state tracking
- [x] Heartbeat sender (background thread)
- [x] Configurable worker ID and port
- [x] Proper logging

### Shared Storage Setup ✅
- [x] Created shared/ directory structure
  - [x] shared/input/
  - [x] shared/output/
  - [x] shared/intermediate/
  - [x] shared/jobs/
- [x] Added .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories
- [x] Configured .gitignore to exclude data files

### Additional Deliverables ✅
- [x] Created requirements.txt with dependencies
- [x] Created client CLI (src/client/client.py)
  - [x] submit command
  - [x] status command
  - [x] list command
  - [x] results command
- [x] Created integration tests (tests/test_week1.py)
  - [x] All 5 tests passing
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation
  - [x] README.md
  - [x] ARCHITECTURE.md
  - [x] DOCKER_NOTES.md
  - [x] WEEK1_SUMMARY.md
- [x] Created helper scripts
  - [x] scripts/upload_data.sh

## Verification ✅

### Code Quality
- [x] All Python files have proper imports
- [x] Proper error handling in place
- [x] Logging configured appropriately
- [x] Code follows Python conventions

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests can be run: `python -m unittest tests.test_week1`
- [x] All 5 integration tests pass
- [x] Coordinator server starts successfully
- [x] Worker server starts successfully
- [x] Client can communicate with coordinator

### Documentation
- [x] README with quick start guide
- [x] Architecture diagrams and flow charts
- [x] Docker setup and troubleshooting notes
- [x] Implementation summary with testing results

### Infrastructure
- [x] Docker Compose configuration valid
- [x] Dockerfiles properly configured
- [x] Shared storage structure in place
- [x] .gitignore properly configured
