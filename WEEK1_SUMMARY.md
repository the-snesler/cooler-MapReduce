# Week 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the Week 1 (Phase 1: Core Infrastructure) implementation for the MapReduce framework.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure ✅
Created a well-organized directory structure:
```
cooler-MapReduce/
├── proto/              # gRPC protocol definitions
├── src/
│   ├── coordinator/   # Coordinator server implementation
│   ├── worker/        # Worker server implementation
│   └── client/        # Client CLI implementation
├── shared/            # Shared storage (mounted to containers)
│   ├── input/
│   ├── output/
│   ├── intermediate/
│   └── jobs/
├── tests/             # Integration and unit tests
├── examples/          # Example MapReduce applications (for Week 4)
└── scripts/           # Helper scripts
```

### 2. Dependencies ✅
- Created `requirements.txt` with:
  - grpcio==1.60.0
  - grpcio-tools==1.60.0
  - protobuf==4.25.1

### 3. gRPC Service Definitions ✅

#### coordinator.proto
Defines the CoordinatorService with RPCs:
- `SubmitJob`: Submit a new MapReduce job
- `GetJobStatus`: Query job status
- `ListJobs`: List all jobs
- `GetJobResults`: Get job output information

#### worker.proto
Defines the WorkerService with RPCs:
- `Heartbeat`: Worker health check
- `AssignTask`: Assign a task to worker
- `GetTaskStatus`: Query task status

### 4. Docker Configuration ✅

#### docker-compose.yml
- 1 Coordinator container (port 50051)
- 4 Worker containers (worker-1 through worker-4)
- Each worker limited to 1 CPU via deploy.resources.limits
- Shared volume mounted at /shared for all containers
- Custom network for inter-container communication

#### Dockerfiles
- `Dockerfile.coordinator`: Builds coordinator image
- `Dockerfile.worker`: Builds worker image
- Both include gRPC code generation step

### 5. Coordinator Implementation ✅

Features:
- gRPC server on port 50051
- Job submission with unique job ID generation
- Job state tracking (status, task counts)
- All RPC endpoints implemented with basic functionality
- Proper logging and error handling

### 6. Worker Implementation ✅

Features:
- gRPC server with configurable port
- Worker ID and coordinator address configuration via CLI args
- Heartbeat sender (background thread)
- Task assignment handling
- Task state tracking
- Proper logging

### 7. Client CLI ✅

Commands implemented:
```bash
# Submit a job
python src/client/client.py submit --input <path> --output <path> --job-file <path> --num-map <n> --num-reduce <n>

# Get job status
python src/client/client.py status --job-id <id>

# List all jobs
python src/client/client.py list

# Get job results
python src/client/client.py results --job-id <id>
```

### 8. Shared Storage ✅
- Directory structure created
- .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories
- .gitignore configured to exclude data files but keep structure

### 9. Testing ✅

Created `tests/test_week1.py` with integration tests:
- Test coordinator connection
- Test job submission
- Test job status query
- Test job listing
- Test job results query

All tests pass ✅

### 10. Documentation ✅
- README.md: Comprehensive guide with quick start and usage
- DOCKER_NOTES.md: Docker-specific notes and troubleshooting
- Helper script: scripts/upload_data.sh for uploading data to shared storage

## Testing Results

### Local Component Tests
✅ Coordinator server starts successfully
✅ Worker server starts successfully  
✅ Client can communicate with coordinator
✅ All gRPC endpoints respond correctly

### Integration Tests
✅ All 5 integration tests pass:
  - test_01_coordinator_connection
  - test_02_submit_job
  - test_03_get_job_status
  - test_04_list_jobs
  - test_05_get_job_results

## What's Working

1. **gRPC Communication**: All components can communicate via gRPC
2. **Job Submission**: Clients can submit jobs to coordinator
3. **State Tracking**: Coordinator tracks job state
4. **Worker Registration**: Workers can connect to coordinator
5. **CLI Interface**: All client commands work correctly

## What's NOT Yet Implemented (Future Weeks)

These are intentionally left for later weeks:

- **Week 2**: Task execution logic, data partitioning, map/reduce operations
- **Week 3**: Combiner support
- **Week 4**: Example applications, performance benchmarks

## How to Verify

### Local Testing (Without Docker)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start coordinator
python src/coordinator/server.py

# Terminal 2: Start a worker
python src/worker/server.py --worker-id worker-1 --port 50052

# Terminal 3: Submit a test job
python src/client/client.py submit \
  --input /shared/input/test.txt \
  --output /shared/output/test \
  --job-file /shared/jobs/test.py \
  --num-map 4 \
  --num-reduce 2

# Check job status
python src/client/client.py list
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_week1 -v
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
# Build and start all containers
docker-compose up --build

# In another terminal, use the client
python src/client/client.py submit <args>
```

## Success Criteria Met ✅

All Week 1 requirements from design.md have been completed:
- ✅ Docker Compose setup
- ✅ gRPC service definitions  
- ✅ Basic coordinator scaffolding
- ✅ Basic worker scaffolding
- ✅ Shared storage setup

## Next Steps (Week 2)

Week 2 will focus on MapReduce core functionality:
- Task scheduling and distribution
- Map task execution
- Reduce task execution
- Data partitioning and shuffling

The infrastructure is now ready for Week 2 implementation!
